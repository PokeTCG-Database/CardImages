# Pokémon TCG Card Images

## The images contained in this repo are for database and archival purposes. The cards and images themselves are copyright of Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, Nintendo, Creatures, Wizards of the Coast, and/or the artist listed on each individual card. This repo is not produced, endorsed, supported, or affiliated by the previously mentioned copyright owners.
## NOTE: this is still a work in progress

The goal of this repo is to contain a copy of every single pokemon tcg card (including foreign languages and variants) and have each filename consistent in such a way that it'll be compatible with my PokéTCG Database (also still a work in progress).

Eventually after I get things further along, I will allow others to contribute any card images that may be missing.
